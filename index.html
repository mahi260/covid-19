            <h1>WHAT IS CORONAVIRUS?</h1>
            <p>A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.
                <br><br>
                In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world.
                <br><br>
                COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).
                <br><br>
                It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections range from mild to deadly.
                <br><br>
                SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but arenâ€™t a serious threat for otherwise healthy people.

            <h1>WHAT IS COVID-19?</h1>
            <p>While coronaviruses are common, coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus that had previously not been identified in humans. 
                <br><br>
                The key features of COVID-19 are respiratory symptoms with a fever and cough. Like all new infections, understanding COVID-19 is important and changes rapidly.
                
                 The CDC is proactively monitoring the virus and taking measures like providing guidance for health care workers and issuing travel recommendations.
                <br><br>
                How are coronaviruses spread?
                <br><br>
                An investigation of the COVID-19 is still ongoing but other human coronaviruses are spread through person-to-person contact. Similar to cold and flu, a person becomes sick through close contact with an infected person. 
                <br><br>
                The virus is spread through respiratory droplets produced by an infected person through coughing and sneezing or by touching surfaces with the virus on them

            <div class="flex1"><h1>Prevention</h1>
            <p>Wash your hands
                <br><br>
                Wear a mask
                <br><br>
                Don't touch your face
                <br><br>
                Stay at home
                <br><br>
                Keep 6 feet away from others 
                
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex2">
                <h1>Face masks and respiratory hygiene</h1>
                 <p>The CDC and WHO recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symtomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing. Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing. Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.
                    <br>
                    
                            Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease. When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available. Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged. Healthcare professionals interacting directly with COVID-19 patients are advised to use respirators at least as protective as NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent, in addition to other personal protective equipment.
